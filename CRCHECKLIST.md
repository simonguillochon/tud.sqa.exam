# CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST

- [ ] Null checks
> Code does not generate new NullPointerException

- [ ] Exception handling
> A try-catch block should be used for exception handling with proper logging in the catch block

- [ ] Code indentation and formatting
> Indentation has been checked with and IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse) and code is readable.

- [ ] Imports optimization
> Imports have been optimized in Java classes.

- [ ] Naming convention
> Variables, methods and classes are named following convention.

- [ ] White-spaces
> White-spaces are separating operators and keyword with parentheses.

- [ ] Brackets
> Brackets are used for all `while`, `for` or `if` even if they are one-liners.

- [ ] Documentation
> All methods are properly commented

- [ ] Code performance optimization
> `for` used instead of `while`, `switch` instead of `if` and business logic is simple enough.
